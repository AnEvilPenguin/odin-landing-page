## Project Synopsis

The aim of this project is to produce a fully fledged webpage from scratch, based around a design brief.  The brief itself consists of two images, and some implementation details such as the required font and colour scheme.

## Learning Objectives

In general this project is based around taking a project from an empty repository to a working implementation with minimal guidance.  There is a specification to work to, but otherwise I will be expected to implement this based on the knowledge gained from the Foundations course thus far.

There are some specifics deliberately omitted from the lesions up to this point to introduce researching how to achieve unknown objectives.
